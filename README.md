wifi-lbs
========

A small android wifi scanner that uploads all found AP on to google fusion table.

Caveat

This project still uses the old Google API Key scheme to connect to the FusionTable, thus require the following deprecated client:

It should be trivial to update the Activity class to support OAuth sign in.
